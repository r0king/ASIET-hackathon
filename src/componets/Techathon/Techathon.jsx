      A civil engineering technical event intended for engineering/ architecture/ diploma students and/or graduates with sufficient theoretical knowledge and design skills to solve complex civil engineering problems. Registration for the event has to be done individually before the deadline and they can form groups of four after the orientation session provided by the organisers, depending on the areas of expertise of each registered participants.
      The event is planned for a span of 24 hours which will include wide range of civil engineering areas like engineering drawing, planning, construction management, structural design, soil investigation, sanitary engineering and quantity estimation. This is scheduled in four stages and the participants are expected to find creative, feasible and technical solutions to the stated complex problem designed by the event organisers. The stages will be focused on the above-mentioned areas and will be evaluated by a panel of experts.
      Essential and relevant training and orientation sessions for the stages will be arranged by the organising committee. Training for softwares AutoCAD, STAAD.PRO, STAAD FOUNDATION, REVIT, PRIMAVERA will be provided prior to the event for registered participants. Certificates will be provided for successful completion of training.
      The winners of the event as decided by an expert jury panel will be awarded a cash prize of one lakh rupees.
